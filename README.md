A simple ctypes python wrapper designed to be simple, geneirc,
clear, and pythonic.

I was going to name this project pytrace or ptracepy, but there are so
damn many projects with names similar already that I decided to name
it something totally different. Since one of my ideas was ptracepy
(pronounced "pee trace pie") I figured urinalcake was close enough.
