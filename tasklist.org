#+TODO: TODO(t) | BLOCKED(b) DONE(d) FUCKTHISSHITNOPE(f)
* TODO make Process use internal wait to set last status
** use this to make sure thing is running 
* Break code in to multiple files (I will handle this)
  lets discuss organization
** Isolate all ctypes and direct C interfaces to directory of their own
*** (long distance) replace all ctypes with library that parses c
* document everything for make of good introspect
* fix all "live" functionality
** DONE unit test all reads by exposing core functionality and verifying it reflects wrapped functionality
** make sure that reg changes are reflected 
*** test case for this should be change output of `ls /` to "hello world"
** make sure memory reads and writes are live
*** test case for this should be change output of `ls /` to "hello world"
* Add unit testing for all functionality
** use `doctest` module. 
*** every method should contain code examples
* Make all code pep8 compliant
* finish adding all ptrace functionality
** PTRACE_SETOPTIONS
** PTRACE_LISTEN
** PTRACE_SEIZE
* add file descriptor list that is a Live list
** add functionality to swap file descriptors
*** This should be a method of Program as in Program.swapfd(old_fd, new_fd)
* add disassembly
** Should be able to call a method that disassembles 
   a number of instructions after ip taking a parameter of how many
* flow graphing
* call stack map
** resolve call stack to function names
* function symbol resolution
* type wrappers that take a word and intepret as int or uint
* register aliases, e.g: 
  regs.rax == 64 bit register (if amd64)
  regs.eax == bottom 32 bits of rax
  regs.ax == bottom 16 bits of eax
  regs.al == bottom 8 bits of ax
** see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Architectural_features for details
* Make memory maps live
* fix next_syscall to actually get next syscall
** This should involve checking that the signal type is of type sigtrap??
* make iter_step and iter_syscall actually work
* fix error handling
** Errors are well documented in the man pages
*** errors that are handled by the rror dict should all have their own Exception
* Build a table of syscalls 
  http://docs.cs.up.ac.za/programming/asm/derick_tut/syscalls.html
** Syscalls should be resolved on request to a table that inits a syscall object
*** This object should explain which regs mean what
*** any time a syscall is hit during next_syscall it should fire a hook
**** It should be possible to add hooks with a decorator     
***** This decorator should be named @sys_<call>_hook, eg @sys_write_hook
* add a "simple" way to inject code 
** e.g.: generate a function that acts like a decorator
*** is this possible??
* Make work on BSD, OSX, iOS
* Make work on arm, mips, ppc
* replicate as much functionality as possible in windows
* write a wrapper that exposes functionality based on OS
* find a way to turn this in to a stand-alone binary using evil hackery
* write a front end that displays useful info
* DONE add ability to launch process and trace (PTRACE_TRACME)
** This may be best done by inheritnig Process as NewProcess
** Change Process to reflect the functionality of PTRACE_SEIZE
** TODO create `seize`, `attach`, and `trace_launch` helper functions
